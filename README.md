# Motivation

The goal of this is to provide a easy-to-use web application to help you with all those small, frequent calculations you do while doing embedded engineering (or other forms of engineering). Whether it be a low-pass LC filter, a resistor divider, trying to find PCB track current, or even just Ohm's law (o.k., I hope you don't forget that one, but it is included none-the-less), this app makes them easy to find, use, and have confidence in the answers.
