<h1>What Is This?</h1>

<p>Enter your desired resistance, and this calculator will find the closest <i>preferred value</i> (purchasable resistance) in each one of the EIA <i>E series</i>, from E6 to E192. The percentage difference between your desired resistance and the preferred value is also shown for each E series.</p>

<p>More information on the E series can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/resistors#the-e-series">http://www.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/resistors#the-e-series</a>.</p>

<h1>Accuracy</h1>

<p>Note that although the E48 series has more values per decade than say, the E24 series, you might find a closer resistance in the E24 series due to the E6, E12 and E24 using a different number sequence to the E48, E96 and E192 series.</p>

<p>If your desired resistance is exactly half-way (in percentage terms) between two preferred values, this calculator will choose the higher resistance.</p>
