        <p>This calculator uses the <i>August-Roche-Magnus equation</i> (also known just as <i>Magnus equation</i>) to allow the calculation of either air temperature, relative humidity, or the dew point (as a temperature, also known as the <i>dew point temperature</i>), when you know the other two values.</p>

        <p>The dew point is given as:</p>

        <p>$$ T_{dp} = \frac{c*(ln(RH) + \frac{b \cdot T_{air}}{c \cdot T_{air}})}{b - ln(RH) - \frac{b \cdot T_{air}}{c \cdot T_{air}}} $$</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            where:<br>
            \( T_{dp} \) = the dew point temperature, in degrees Celcius<br>
            \( RH \) = The relative humidity, as a number between 0-1 (i.e. percentage divided by 100)<br>
            \( b \) = A Magnus equation coefficient, which has no unit<br>
            \( c \) = A Magnus equation coefficient, in degrees Celcius<br>
        <p>

        <p>The exact values for the Magnus equation coefficients \(b\) and \(c\) depend on the exact literature that you the equation from. Common values for both are:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            \( b = 17.625 \)<br>
            \( c = 243.03^{\circ}C \)
        </p>
