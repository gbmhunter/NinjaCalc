<p>Use this calculator to find the maximum current that a PCB via can handle (a.k.a. as it's <i>ampacity</i>). This calculator uses equations formed from the data presented in the IPC-2221A standard. This equation takes into account the via diameter, via plating thickness and permissible temperature rise.</p>

<p>The equation used to calculate the maximum via current is:</p>

<p>$$ I = \Delta T^b \cdot A^c $$</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    where:<br>
    \( I \) = the max. current allowed through the via, in Amps.<br>
    \( \Delta T \) = the maximum permissible temperature rise of the via above ambient, in \(^{\circ}C\). \(20\) to \(40^{\circ}C\) is a common value for this.<br>
    \( b \) = A co-efficient from the IPC-2221A standard.<br>
    \( A \) = the cross-sectional area of the via (the area of the via as looking top down onto it), in \(mills^2\) (imperial).<br>
    \( c \) = A co-efficient from the IPC-2221A standard.
<p>

<p>This calculator, when given the via length and plated copper resistivity (default value provided, only change if necessary), will also find approximate values for the electrical and thermal resistance of the via.</p>

<p>The via's resistance is calculated with the equation:</p>

<p>$$ R = \frac{\rho l}{A} $$</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    where:<br>
    \( R \) is the resistance of the via, as measured from it's top surface to it's bottom surface, in \(\Omega\).<br>
    \( \rho \) is the resistivity of plated copper, in \( \Omega \cdot m \). A default value of \(19e^{-9}\Omega m\) is provided for this variable.<br>
    \( l \) is the length of the via (a.k.a. it's height), in \(m\).<br>
    \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the via (the area of the via as looking top down onto it), in \(m^2\).
<p>

<p>The thermal resistance is calculated with the equation:</p>

<p>$$ R_{\theta} = \frac{R_{plated-copper} \cdot l}{A} $$</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    where:<br>
    \( R_{\theta} \) is the thermal resistance of the via, in \(K/W\).<br>
    \( R_{plated-copper} \) is the specific thermal resistivity of plated copper, in \( K \cdot m / W \). A default value of \(2.489e^{-3}Km/W \) is provided for this variable.<br>
    \( l \) is the length of the via (a.k.a. it's height), in \(m\).<br>
    \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the via (the area of the via as looking top down onto it), in \(m^2\).
<p>

<p>Remember this calculator does not take into account other nearby heat sources.</p>
