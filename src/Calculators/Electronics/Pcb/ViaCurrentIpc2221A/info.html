<p>This calculator can find the minimum PCB track width (external or internal layer) given the track current, the
    allowed temperature rise, and copper layer thickness.</p>

<p>Calculated in accordance with the equations in IPC-2221A Section 6.2 (formerly IPC-D-275, the equation has not
    changed between these two standards amd you can get similar values by curve-fitting to the graphs provided in
    IPC-D-275, drawn in 1954, woah!</p>

<p>$$ I = k\Delta T^b A^c $$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">where:<br>
    \( k \) = 0.048 for external traces, 0.024 for internal tracks<br>
    \( \Delta T \) = the change in temperature (temperature rise) in \( ^{\circ}C \)<br>
    \( b \) = 0.44<br>
    \( A \) = cross-sectional area in \( mils^2 \)<br>
    \( c \) = 0.725<br>
</p>

<p>The standard only covers values where the current is 0-35A, track width is 0-10.16mm, temperature rise is from
    10-100C, and the copper from 0.5-3oz. Values outside this range are extrapolated (and there more error-prone) and
    will turn orange.</p>

<p>This also assumes the track is sufficiently long enough the the end-points do not have a significant effect on the
    heatsinking. For example, this calcultor should not be used for calculating the width of thermal-relief style
    connections from a copper pour to a via, in where the track is very short (0.2-1.0mm). It also assumes there are no
    vias along the length of the track.</p>

<p>The current in assumed to be constant (DC). However, you can use the RMS value for a pulsed current as long as the
    pulses are fast enough.</p>

<p>The temperature of the PCB material should NEVER exceed the relative thermal index (RTI) of the material. This is
    defined in UL746B as the temperature at which 50% of the materials properties are retained after 100,000 hours.</p>

<p>Remember this calculator does not take into account other nearby heat sources.</p>
